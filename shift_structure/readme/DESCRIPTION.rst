Add a 'structure' field on shifts

- The structure field can be defined on the shift template and on the shift. Structure can be chosen among the partner that has the field "is_structure" set to True.
- Structures are displayed on the kanban views in the backend, and the several portal views in the frontend.
- A filter on the structure can be applyed on the irregular shift view in the portal. The filter is based on the structure of the template, not the structure of the shifts.
