Create a member card and link it to a partner.

- each member card has a barcode
- create new cards in the "member card" tab of the partner form
- use "Force Barcode" field to set a user defined barcode
- the partner's card and barcode history is visible in the member card tab
- the barcode of a partner is computed from the last active member card
- a boolean "Print Member card?" allows to filter on partners for which you need to print new cards.

Careful : this module overrides the barcodes already defined on the partners.

Note that there is no member card template in this module, cf ROADMAP.

If point of sale is installed, the generated barcode matches customer pattern rule.
