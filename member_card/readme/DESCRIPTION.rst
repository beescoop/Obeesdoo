Create a member card and link it to a partner.

- each member card has a barcode
- create new cards in the "member card" tab of the partner form
- the partner's card and barcode history is visible in the member card ta
- the barcode of a partner is computed from the last active member card
- a boolean "Print Member card?" allows to filter on partners for which you need to print new cards.

Careful : this module overrides the barcodes already defined on the partners.

Note that there is no member card template in this module, cf ROADMAP.
