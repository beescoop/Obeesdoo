# Create development environment using docker

> Tested on fedora 31

## 1) install Docker

Checkout the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/) from docker.
TODO: make it work with [podman](https://podman.io/).

Be sure to start the docker daemon using `systemctl start docker` (enable if you want it to persist on reboot).
Depending on the distribution, you might need to either use sudo or create a docker group.
The following instructions assume that you can use docker without being root, add sudo if necessary.

## 2) Build the images (odoo - postgresql)
~ 15 minutes
```bash
docker-compose build
```

## 3) Load data in postgresql

Copy the sql.gz dump into the `initial-data-load` folder.
Prefix it with 02, so that it is loaded after user creation and before the crons are stopped.
```bash
docker-compose up db
```

This could take a while (~20 minutes) depending on the data dump you are using.
In order to reset your database, remove the container. 
(It will have to rebuild the database the next time you start it).
```bash
docker-compose rm db
```

## 4) Run the project
If you are not using a pre-created db run 
```bash
docker-compose run odoo python3 odoo-bin -d beescoop -i base -c odoo.conf
```

All the modules need to be updated in order to be recognised.
To do that run 
```bash
docker-compose run -p 8096:8096 odoo python odoo.py -c odoo.conf -d beescoop -u all
```

Once the update has been done, you can simply run the whole project by running
```bash
docker-compose up
```

I like to start the database in the background to only have the logs of the application.
```bash
docker-compose up -d db 
docker-compose up odoo 
``` 
 
## 5) Login
To login you may either use your account or the admin account whose password should have been reset to admin.
