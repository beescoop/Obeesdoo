            deleted, along with its corresponding ir.model.data record. this
            normally causes this record to be re-created when updating the
            module, even though it is set as noupdate, because it is seen as
            new data, effectively resetting the value to true. the forcecreate
            property set to false ensures that this record is not recreated on
            module update.
