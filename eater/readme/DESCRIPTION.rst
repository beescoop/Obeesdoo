This module adds the "eater" and "worker" concepts to partners of your participative shop.

- the worker is a voluntary worker of your supermarket
- the eater, linked to a worker, is usually given the same access rights as the worker

The eater tab is displayed for worker partner.
A button in this tab allows to create and link an eater to a partner.
