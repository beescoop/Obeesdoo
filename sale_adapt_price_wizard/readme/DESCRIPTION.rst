- Adds "Edit Price" submenu on Purchase and Sale modules.
  The user lands on an editable List View with the following columns :

  - Name (`name`)
  - Main Seller (`main_seller_id`)
  - Purchase Price (`purchase_price`)
  - Purchase Unit of Measure (`uom_po_id`)
  - Suggested Price (`suggested_price`)
  - Sales Price (`list_price`)
  - Unit of Measure (`uom_id`)

  The only editable field is Purchase Price.
  Through "Action > Adapt Sales Price", the user can, on the selected products,
  adapt the Sales Price according to the Suggested Price.
  Alternatively, 'Automatically write suggested price' can be enabled to make
  this last step automatic.
