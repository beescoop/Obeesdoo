Do not apply a penalty to irregular customers twice in a row. Best explained
through an example.

Imagine the following 'sr' of an irregular worker:

0 -> -2 (cron, penalty) -> -1 (work a shift) -> 0 (work another shift)
-> ??? (cron)

The last step should go to -1 instead of -2. The penalty should not be given
again until sr has reached 1.
