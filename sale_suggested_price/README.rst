- Add a 'Suggested Price' field on products, and a 'Product Margin' field on Partners (Vendors) and Product Categories.
  The first margin is used if set, otherwise the second margin (which has a default value) is used.
- The reference price on which this margin is applied (supplier price or sale price)
  can be selected in the general settings.
- Also, sale and supplier taxes that are of type 'percentage' and that are marked as 'included in price'
  are taken into account when computing the suggested price.
- Round suggested price to 5 cents
- Allows adapting a product's purchase and/or selling price from a PO.

Please note that this model makes assumptions when computing the suggested price:

- It supposes that each product has only one supplier and that products coming from multiple suppliers
  occur as duplicated products with one supplier each.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- During migration : rationalise with odoo standard module's sale_margin
- Refactor product_category._round:
    set rounding_precision and rounding_method to required
    remove default values from the _round method
